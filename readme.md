## tjk-scrapper 
tjk data scraper. Since TJK does not have an open API that I could find, most of the HTML structure we receive by requesting the site is processed and displayed using ready-made packages. This application is being developed with go. 

## Run
In application folder you can simple run command below.

```
go run main.go
```
